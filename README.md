## Effects of Cychrome P450 2C19 and Paraoxonase 1 Polymorphisms on Antiplatelet Response to Clopidogrel Therapy in Parients with Coronary Artery Disease
| Question from the article | Knowledge topic, I want to learn |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
|If patient have polymorphisms and still take the Clopidogel, Do it have any result to their body in the long term? | Biochemistry |
|What is Linkage disequlilbrium? | Genetic |
|What is vitro metabolomic profiling techniques?| Genetic Engineering |
|If patient have both polymorphisme in PON1 and CYP2C19*2,*3, Do we have another medicine or methond that can help? | Biochemistry |
|What is oxidative stress? | Biology |
|Why smoking status and diabetes mellitus are been known to be associated with high oxidative stress? | Biology |
|What is ADP-induced platelet aggregation? | Biochemistry |
|Why choose only PON1 and CYP2C19*2,*3 polymorphism in Clopidogrel therapy? Do it have another gene affect response to Clopidogrel therapy?| Biochemistry |

## Molecular investigarion by whole exome sequencing revealed a high proportion of pathogenic variants among Thai victims of sudden unexpected death syndrome
| Question from the article | Knowledge topic, I want to learn |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
|What function of 'TTN' gene and 'SCN5A' before gene mutation?| Mutation Gene |
|How can we prevent the SUDS from another people that did not have SUDS patients in the family? | Genetic, Method, Preventing |
|Why do we need to use WSE method? Can we use another method for sequencing? | Gene sequencing |
|Do the environment affective to the mutation gene? Did the Thai people that immigated to another country have SUDS? | Affective of gene due to environment |
|What is the 'MetaSVM'? How it show the result and what the process that be tolerable the possible genes? | Candidate variant filtration |
|If we find the reason of mutation in TTN, can we reduce the number of SUDS patient? |Gene mutation|
|Do it have person that have gene TTN mutation and still alive? If have, what dirrent gene between this person and SUDS patient? | Whole Genome |
